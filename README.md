## Production

To run this application in production, you need to build and serve the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Invoke the `build` script by running `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `./build` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Finally run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to run Node in production and serve application from the `./build` directory.
1. When you're ready to go live, see [Deployment](#deployment) for more details.
